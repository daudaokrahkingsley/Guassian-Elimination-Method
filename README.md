#Gauss elimination method
Gauss elimination method is used to solve a system of linear equations. Letâ€™s recall the definition of these systems of equations. A system of linear equations is a group of linear equations with various unknown factors. As we know, unknown factors exist in multiple equations. Solving a system involves finding the value for the unknown factors to verify all the equations that make up the system. 

In this aglorithm, a n-by-(n+1) dimentional matrix A is implemened using the Gaussian Elimination Method.
